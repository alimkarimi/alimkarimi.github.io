      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Alim Karimi and I built this website to tell the world a little bit about myself!</p>

      <p> I am a northern California native and went to my undergrad at UC Davis where I studied Environmental Science and Mangagement. 
        It was here where I first took a course with Dr. Susan Ustin and was absolutely in awe of what humans could achieve 
        using sensors in space, computer science, and image processing. </p>

        <p>This interest has taken me to some really fun adventures over the years:</p>
        <p>- Google Maps 3D maps project</p>
        <p>- A series A drone imaging startup</p>
        <p>- Planet Labs as a Technical Program Manager and Data Scientist.</p>
        <p>- Graduate school at Purdue University (yes I felt the midwest was kind of cold but beautiful too :) </p>

       <p>Overall, I am very intersted in computer science, machine learning, remote sensing, and product management.</p>

      <h2>Machine Learning Papers and Posteres</h2>
      <p>In December 2024 I will attend NeurIPS to present my work on flood prediction. Flooding is an extreme climate event and therefore does not have 
      a lot of data to build ML models with, especially deep learning models. In this work, I propose a method to first create a baseline of performance 
      using statistcal models, then incorporate remote sensing to generate more validation data. The goal is that with more validation points, deep learning 
      models can be leveraged.</p>

    <section id="research interests">
      <h2>Research Interests</h2>
      <p>I am actively researching applied solutions in climate and remote sensing. I am also generally interested in time dependent neural network architectures like LSTMs and 
      transformers.

      In graduate school, I worked with Dr. Melba Crawford at the Purdue Laboratory of Remote Sensing Applications to develop many-to-many LSTMs and Transformer models to 
        estimate Leaf Area Index from remote sensing observations.
